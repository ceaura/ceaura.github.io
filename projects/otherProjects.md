### **Speakanoid**
A 2D typing game developed in Unity during **Trijam 322**, where each participant had only **3 hours of development time**.  
The player controls an anxious alien giving a speech about humans each typing mistake increases its anxiety level until it breaks down.  
The theme of the jam was *“Your fears are the game mechanics.”*

### **Godot Projects**
During my final year of my **BUT Informatique**, I collaborated with two classmates on a small **Asteroids-like** game using **Godot**.  
The player controls the ship from an Android tablet through **TCP/UDP commands**, allowing me to experiment with **network communication in Godot**.

### **Volunteering**
During the 2024–2025 academic year, I volunteered with **AFEV**, providing two hours per week of academic support to a primary school student.
In April 2025, I also volunteered with **Les Comploteurs Festifs**, a student association that organizes a two-day music festival at the university each year, where I was part of the catering team.

### **Learning Computer Graphics**
Currently learning **OpenGL** by developing small projects to understand the **graphics pipeline** and how to work with **shaders**.  
This exploration helps me deepen my understanding of rendering, GPU communication, and low-level graphics programming in **C++**.

---

### **Learning Unreal Engine**
Currently following the Udemy course *“Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course.”*  
I'm exploring the engine’s workflow, scripting in C++, and understanding its architecture to broaden my game programming skills.
