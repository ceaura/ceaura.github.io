## Prototypes & Experiments

### **Speakanoid**
A 2D typing game developed in Unity during **Trijam 322**, where each participant had only **3 hours of development time**.  
The player controls an anxious alien giving a speech about humans — each typing mistake increases its anxiety level until it breaks down.  
The theme of the jam was *“Your fears are the game mechanics.”*

### **Godot Projects**
During my final year of my **BUT Informatique**, I collaborated with two classmates on a small **Asteroids-like** game using **Godot**.  
The player controls the ship from an Android tablet through **TCP/UDP commands**, allowing me to experiment with **network communication in Godot**.

### **Learning Unreal Engine**
Currently following the Udemy course *“Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course.”*  
I'm exploring the engine’s workflow, scripting in C++, and understanding its architecture to broaden my game programming skills.

### **Learning Computer Graphics**
Currently learning **OpenGL** by developing small projects to understand the **graphics pipeline** and how to work with **shaders**.  
This exploration helps me deepen my understanding of rendering, GPU communication, and low-level graphics programming in **C++**.
